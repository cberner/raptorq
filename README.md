Rust implementation of RaptorQ (RFC6330)

Recovery properties:
Reconstruction probability after receiving K + h packets = 1 - 1/256^(h + 1). Where K is the number of packets in the
original message, and h is the number of additional packets received.
See "RaptorQ Technical Overview" by Qualcomm

### Examples
See the `examples/` directory for usage.

### Public API
Note that the additional classes exported by the `benchmarking` feature flag are not considered part of this
crate's public API. Breaking changes to those classes may occur without warning. The flag is only provided
so that internal classes can be used in this crate's benchmarks.

## Python bindings

The Python bindings are generated using [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3). 
Rust 1.37.0-nightly or higher is required for building [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) projects.
```
$ rustup install nightly
$ rustup override set nightly
```

Some operating systems require additional packages to be installed.
```
$ sudo apt install python3-dev
```

[maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is recommended for building the Python bindings in this crate.
```
$ pip install maturin
$ maturin build
```

Alternatively, refer to the [Building and Distribution section](https://pyo3.rs/v0.8.5/building_and_distribution.html) in the [pyo3 user guide](https://pyo3.rs/v0.8.5/).
