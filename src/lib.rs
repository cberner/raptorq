//! An implementation of RaptorQ, the fountain code defined in
//! [RFC 6330](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6330).
//!
//! # Erasure correction, not error detection
//!
//! RaptorQ recovers *erasures*: packets that were lost in transit. Given
//! enough of the packets that were sent, it reconstructs the original object
//! regardless of which ones went missing.
//!
//! It does **not** detect *errors*: packets that arrived but were altered.
//! Nothing in the encoded stream identifies a packet as corrupt, so the
//! decoder cannot distinguish a modified packet from a legitimate one.
//!
//! **Callers are responsible for ensuring that data passed to the decode
//! functions is free of corruption.** Verify integrity before decoding, with
//! whatever the surrounding protocol provides — a transport that authenticates
//! its payloads, a checksum, or a signature over each packet.
//!
//! Passing corrupted data in has no single defined outcome. Depending on
//! which bytes were altered, it may:
//!
//! - **return incorrect data**, with no error and no indication that anything
//!   is wrong. This is what happens when a packet's payload is altered but its
//!   length is unchanged: the payload is indistinguishable from a legitimate
//!   symbol, so it is decoded as one;
//! - **panic**, when the corruption changes the length of a packet's payload
//!   to less than the symbol size, or alters the 4-byte FEC Payload ID that
//!   prefixes each packet. Payload lengths and the block and symbol numbers in
//!   the ID are used to index the decoder's state, so a value outside the range
//!   the [`ObjectTransmissionInformation`] describes is out of bounds;
//! - fail to decode and return [`None`], if the corruption cost enough symbols
//!   that not enough remain.
//!
//! None of these should be relied on as a signal, and which one occurs is not
//! part of the API contract. A corruption check that happens *before* decoding
//! is the only thing that makes the outcome well-defined.
